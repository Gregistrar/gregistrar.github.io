## Welcome to my GitHub Page

My first project will use data from [the NHL](https://www.nhl.com/) to create unique visualizations and track advanced stats.

I also want to note that I will be working on a long-term project on political data. The thesis of this data is yet to be determined, but I am looking into water scarcity data as well as voting data.
